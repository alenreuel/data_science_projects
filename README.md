This repository is dedicated to a collection of my Data Analysis and Machine Learning Projects.

## GDM_prediction_visceral_fat_measurements 

**Dataset for the project:** [dataset_link](https://physionet.org/content/maternal-visceral-adipose/1.0.0/) 

This dataset used for the project is from a cohort study of pregnant women up to 20 weeks of pregnancy and followed until delivery. Measurement of maternal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was performed during routine obstetric ultrasound. At this time, the biometric evaluation was also performed, and information obtained from prenatal care. Gestational outcomes, including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), were obtained through evaluating the patients' medical records at the hospitals where they took place. The data was collected as part of a study that sought to evaluate if maternal VAT could predict GDM at time of delivery. Variables included in this dataset are maternal age, previous DM, blood pressure (in the same day of VAT measurement), VAT (in the periumbilical region), gestational age at time of inclusion, number of pregnancies, level of first fasting glucose, pre-gestational body mass index (BMI). Also, the pregnancy outcomes: gestational age at birth, type of delivery (vaginal or caesarean section), child birth weight and the diagnosis of GDM.

In our project we used the dataset to create and evaluate a classification model to predict if a patient sufferes from GDM.

## chatGPT_tweet_sentiment_analysis

**Dataset for the project:** [dataset_link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khalidryder777/500k-chatgpt-tweets-jan-mar-2023)

ChatGPT is a powerful LLM created by OpenAI which has been a recently gained a lot of popularity due to its ablility to perform a wide variety of tasks well and gained a lot of attention on social media platforms where people have been discussing about it. To identify the net sentiment of the public regarding the public, in this project I aim to:
1) Analyse the sentiment of tweets.
2) Identify underlying trends in tweet patterns.
3) Identify what are the possible broad topics of discussion in tweets(based on their Sentiment.)


## airline_network_analysis 

**Dataset for the project:** [dataset_link](https://openflights.org/data.html)

A airline dataset was transformed into Graph data structre, where Airports abd flight paths demonstrated the nodes and edges of a directed multigraph. The objective of the project was to identify any interesting trends between different airports and airline networks.



## brain_tumor_classification_MRI

**Dataset for the project:** [dataset_link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedsorour1/mri-for-brain-tumor-with-bounding-boxes)

In this project we utilize pyTorch library to create and evalaute a Convolutional Neural Network model to predict if there is a Tumor present (Glioma/Meningioma/Pituitary) using MRI images and localize them using bounding boxes. 

## english_to_french_machine_translation 

**Dataset for the project:** [dataset_link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedsorour1/mri-for-brain-tumor-with-bounding-boxes)

Project to create a English to French Language translation model.
